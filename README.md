6 Player Cards Points Tracker
=======

This repository contains my 6 player cards tracker side project.

The goal is to create a mobile web application to track points for the 6 player card game that I play with friends on a regular basis. The app will eventually be used to record points, players and game state and display suitable statistics and graphs with those information.
